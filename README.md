# Simple online shop

## About

This is a simple online shop with no limits regarding the type of products it sells.
Has some basic functionality, such as viewing products, adding them to the cart, leaving product reviews.  
User functionality: logging in, signing out, registering an account;  
Admin functionality: editing users, products, making other users admins.

## Technology stack

- **JavaScript**

  I chose JavaScript over TypeScript primarily because of the speed of development (writing JavaScript  
  is usually faster upfront, plus I have no experience with TypeScript which might also slow  
  me down), and also because this project is relatively small.

- **Express**

  Once again, I choose express over other frameworks because of the scale of the project and  
  some prior experience with it.

- **MongoDB + Mongoose**

  MongoDB is a document-oriented database program, which makes it much easier to work with. It also is  
  has a large community of users that can provide help. Mongoose is an ODM for MongoDB.
